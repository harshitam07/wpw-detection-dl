Detection of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome Using ECG Images

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to accurately detect Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from ECG images. WPW is a condition characterized by an abnormal extra electrical pathway in the heart, leading to episodes of rapid heart rate. The project involves preprocessing ECG images, training the model on a labeled dataset, and evaluating its performance using standard classification metrics. The ultimate goal is to create a reliable and efficient tool for early detection and diagnosis of WPW syndrome, aiding healthcare professionals in timely intervention and treatment.
